                         DeviShell Mk XII
======================================================================

A feature-rich, high-performance, PowerShell-based shell environment
built with Python.

DeviShell wraps the powerful PowerShell 7 engine in a more user-friendly,
customizable, and infinitely extensible Python environment, creating a
"meta-shell" that provides the best of both worlds.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
Features
----------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Hybrid Command System:
    -   Core Built-ins (`cd`, `exit`): Handled directly by Python for
        state management.
    -   Custom Python Commands: A rich suite of tools written in Python
        that are not available in a standard shell.
    -   PowerShell Fallback: Any other command is seamlessly passed to
        the `pwsh.exe` engine, giving you its full power.

*   Dynamic & Informative Prompt:
    -   Displays your current working directory (with `~` for home).
    -   Shows the active Python virtual environment.
    -   Integrates Git to show the current branch and a `*` for dirty status.
    -   Performance-cached to remain snappy even in large repositories.

*   Enhanced Interactivity:
    -   Persistent command history (`.devishell_history`).
    -   Advanced autocompletion for paths, built-ins, and Python commands.
    -   Rich, color-coded feedback for success, errors, and information.

*   Custom Python Command Suite:
    -   `search <term> [-p <path>]`: Recursively search for files/dirs.
    -   `tree [<path>] [-d <depth>]`: Display a visual directory tree.
    -   `mkcd <dirname>`: Create a directory and immediately enter it.
    -   `serve [<port>] [-d <path>]`: Start an instant web server for a directory.
    -   `pwgen [-l <len>] [-c <count>]`: Generate secure, random passwords.
    -   `myip`: Display your local private IP address.

Requirements
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Python 3.8+
2.  PowerShell 7 (`pwsh.exe`) accessible on your system.
3.  Python Libraries:
    -   typer
    -   prompt-toolkit
    -   rich
    -   GitPython
    -   (For building) pyinstaller


----------------------------------------------------------------------
How to Run from Source
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Install the required libraries:
    pip install typer prompt-toolkit rich GitPython

2.  Open `main.py` and ensure the `POWERSHELL_EXECUTABLE` variable
    points to the correct location of your `pwsh.exe`.

3.  Run the shell from your terminal:
    python main.py


----------------------------------------------------------------------
How to Build the Executable
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This process packages the entire application into a single `DeviShell.exe` file.

1.  Install PyInstaller:
    pip install pyinstaller

2.  Ensure your project structure is as follows:
    /
    |-- main.py
    |-- build.bat
    |-- /assets/
        |-- xok.ico

3.  Run the `build.bat` script by double-clicking it.

4.  The script will create a `dist` folder containing the final
    `DeviShell.exe`. All temporary build files will be automatically
    cleaned up. You can then move `DeviShell.exe` anywhere on your system.
